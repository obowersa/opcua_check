# OPCUA Checker
## WIP - Simple and light weight way to check OPCUA connections
Golang CLI which allows for retreieving variables over OPCUA as well as checking basic connectivity information.

Still work in progress. Main areas which need improvement:
- Fleshing out the README
- Supporting more OPCUA functions
- Build/release process ( currently relies on folk reading the makefile )
- Expand the testing to cover the CLI component ( similar to what I did for the wfwiki project ) 
- Add in dockerfile support ( with container structure tests/etc )
